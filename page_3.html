            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                Established in 1964, the Center for the Education of Women+ was a pioneering university women's center.
                Designed to serve the needs of women students as well as women returning to school or work, CEW+ (then
                known as the Center for the Continuing Education of Women) was founded with a three-part mission of
                service, advocacy, and research. The Center for the Education of Women+ (now known as CEW+) continues
                its work today, serving University students, staff and faculty, community members, and all genders,
                facing education, employment, or other life issues.

                non-linear paths to, and experiences within, the University community.
