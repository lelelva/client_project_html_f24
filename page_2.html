                    U-M's Maize & Blue Cupboard (MBC), the College of Engineering, Student Life, and Ann Arbor-based
                    Food Gatherers will host North Campus mobile food distributions to make MBC resources more
                    accessible for North Campus residents. The mobile distribution takes place in the connector

                <p>The initial idea for the North Campus Distribution pilot originated through the COVID Campus
                    Challenge, sponsored by the College of Engineering and Student Life. Students were charged with
                    developing resource ideas to support students during the pandemic. </p>
