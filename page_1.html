            <h2>Academic Advising Overview </h2>
            <p>Academic Advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans with
                guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and questions
                with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of university and program
                requirements, policies, and processes. Together, we develop an academic plan that aligns with the
                student's personal and professional goals. </p>
